and why is it popular?\n","  -Python is a Programming language to interact with Computer by giving some instructions to do work.\n","  -Among others such languages,Python is accepted globally bbecause of its simplicity in commands\n","\n","2) What is an interpreter in Python?\n","  -Interpreter reads the codes line by line and interpret & translates High level language to MAchine language what task is to be done & perform accordingly.\n","\n","3) What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","  -There are total 35 Pre-defined keywords in python which we can't use during writing code as Variables, otherwise it will show an error,\n","\n","4) Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","  -No,but we can use Help command to see all the Pre defined keywords\n","\n","5) What is mutability in Python?\n","  -Mutability is a feature of Data Structure where one Data Structure once created can't be changed if it is Immutable, we use different Data Structures according to their Mutability features as per need.\n","\n","6)  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","  -Lists are ordered or indexed Data Structure, where we can find and replace any Indexed character as per need, whereas, Tuples are Unordered, we can't change the Data inside the Tuple which is once created.\n","\n","7) What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","  -These two are different kind of Operators, '==\" is relational Operator, which Compares the value of two Objects/ Variables, \"is\" is Indentity Operators, which also Compares the Value of two objects, but it compares by the Location of these two for two different memory Block\n","\n","8) What are logical operators in Python?\n","  -depending on the Binary Logic this operators give output, e.g:- AND, NOT, OR\n","\n","9) What is type casting in Python?\n","  -Type casting is a method by which the Data type of any Variable is converted to another Data type.\n","\n","10) What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","  -Implicit Type casting means , Python itself changes the Type of varibales when two different types are available to perform.\n","  -Explicit type casting means, Programmer need to manually change the Type of varibale to perform the desired operation.\n","  -e.g:- to Add one INT and one FLOAT type, Python can automatically coverts the Data type of INT into FLOAT , this is Implicit Type casting, however , we can manually covert the Type by using Float() function, then it is called Explicit type casting\n","\n","11) What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","  -It helps to perform a specific task depending on the Condition is True or False.It helps to control the flow of code.\n","\n","12) How does the elif statement work?\n","  -when multiple IF statements are required, then ELIF is used.\n","\n","13) What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","  -FOR loop is used when the numberof iteration is known, whereas, WHILE loop is used where the iteration number isn't known, and it won't stop till the Condition met.\n","\n","14) Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","  -In case of taking an User input where we dont know the exact number of iteration beforehand, there we should use WHILE loop.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"iykB9jLSbp4B"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical
