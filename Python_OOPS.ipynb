        "1)What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "> Object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods. A class is like a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "> A class is a user-defined Template. It consists of data (Attributes) and member (methods), which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.\n",
        ">> Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brands but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range, etc. So here, Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, mileage are their properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "3)What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "> An Object is an instance of a Class. An object has an identity, state, and behavior.\n",

        "> Abstraction:-\n",
        ">> Hides complex implementation details, showing only essential features. Achieved using abstract classes, interfaces, or methods that hide details.\n",
        ">>> Example: you use a TV remote without knowing how the circuits inside work—you only care about changing channels or volume\n",
        "\n",
        "> Encapsulation:\n",
        ">> Bundles data and methods into a single unit and restricts direct access to some components. Achieved using access modifiers (private, protected, public) and methods like getters/setters\n",
        ">>> Example: the TV’s internal circuits are hidden inside the case, and you interact only through buttons or the remote\n",
        "\n",
        "5) What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "> Dunder methods in Python, short for \"double underscore\" methods, are special methods whose names start and end with two underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__). These methods allow our custom classes to interact seamlessly with Python's built-in functions and operators.\n",
        ">> Example: When we use `+` on objects, Python looks for the `__add__` dunder method.\n",
        "\n",
        "6)Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "> Inheritance in OOP is like creating a family tree for our classes. It allows us to make a new class (called a child or subclass) that automatically gets the features (attributes and methods) of an existing class (called a parent or superclass\n",
        ">> Think of a video game with many types of vehicles: cars, trucks, and airplanes. Instead of writing all the details for each vehicle from scratch, we can create a general Vehicle class with common features (like move and stop). Then, we make a Car class and a Truck class that inherit everything from Vehicle—they automatically have move and stop, and we can add or change features just for cars or trucks\n",

        "9) What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "> A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created. It allows us to set up the initial state of an object,The constructor method in Python is called `__init__()`.It takes `self` as its first parameter.We don’t need to call `__init__()` explicitly—it runs automatically when the object is instantiated.\n",
        "* Example:-\n",

        "11)What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "> Method overloading is a concept where multiple methods in the same class share the same name but differ in the number or type of parameters.Python handles method overloading using default arguments or the *args and **kwargs mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "12) What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "> Method overriding in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a feature that allows a child class to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class\n",
        "\n",
        "13) What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "> The @property decorator in Python is a simple way to make a method in a class act like an attribute. This means we can access the value by writing object.attribute instead of calling a method like object.get_attribute().It's useful for making attributes read-only\n",
        "* Example:-\n",
        "      class Person:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, name):\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14) Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "> Polymorphism is important because it allows the same method name to work with different types of objects, each providing its own behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "15) What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "> An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be a blueprint for other classes.\n",

        "> OOP makes software development more efficient, secure, maintainable, and scalable by organizing code into reusable, modular, and self-contained objects\n",
        ">> Encapsulation: Data and functions are bundled together in objects, protecting the integrity of the code\n",
        ">> Abstraction: Unnecessary details are hidden, allowing developers to focus on essential functionalities while simplifying complex systems.\n",
        ">> Polymorphism: This enables objects to take multiple forms, providing flexibility in code implementation and enhancing extensibility.\n",
        ">> Reusability: Code can be reused across different applications through inheritance, reducing redundancy and saving time\n",
        "\n",
        "17) What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "> A class variable is shared by every object of the class—changing it in one place changes it for all.\n",

        "> An instance variable is unique to each object—changing it affects only that specific object\n",
        "\n",
        "18) What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "> Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, it gains access to their properties and behaviors.\n",
        "* Example:-\n",
        "      class Parent1:\n",

        "21) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "> The `__del__` method in Python is a destructor that gets called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected). Its primary significance lies in cleanup operations, such as releasing resources like files, network connections, or memory when an object is no longer needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22) What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "> @staticmethod when method doesn’t need to know anything about the class or its instances—just a regular function inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "> @classmethod when method needs to work with the class itself (for example, to change class variables or create new instances)\n",
        "\n",
        "23) How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "> Polymorphism with inheritance in Python means we can use a shared interface (like a method name) across different classes, and each class can have its own specific behavior for that method.\n",
        ">> Method Overriding (Inheritance-based polymorphism)- A child class provides a specific implementation of a method defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "24) What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "> Method chaining is a technique used in (OOP) where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement. Each method returns `self` (the instance of the class), allowing subsequent method calls to chain together\n",

        "\n",
        "25) What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "> The `__call__` method in Python allows us to make instances of a class behave like functions. When we define `__call__` inside a class, we can \"call\" an object of that class using parentheses, just like we would call a function. This means that the object becomes callable and can accept arguments when called\n",
